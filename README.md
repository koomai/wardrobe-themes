Themes for Wardrobe CMS
================

### DEPRECATED

This package is no longer maintained.

---

This package currently contains a basic two-column theme for [Wardrobe](http://wardrobecms.com). It uses most of Bootstrap 3's default styles with minimal overrides. Bootstrap 3 is designed to be mobile-first, so this theme plays nice with smaller screens. It also can be easily configured to use [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) themes - see **Configuration**.

The goal is to add more themes based on other frameworks.

###How to Install###
1. Run *composer update* to install. Alternatively you can install it directly via composer on your Wardrobe installation:

          composer require koomai/wardrobe-themes:dev-master

2. Add the Service Provider to *config/app.php* (at the end of the *providers* array)

          'Koomai\WardrobeThemes\WardrobeThemesServiceProvider',
3. Publish this package's configuration file

          php artisan wardrobethemes:config
4. Copy this package's themes to the *public/themes* folder
          
          php artisan wardrobethemes:assets

Note: The artisan commands will overwrite previous files. If you've made custom modifications, do not run these commands without backing up your Wardrobe Themes config file (in config/packages) and themes directory (in public/themes)

In your Wardrobe config file *(config/packages/wardrobe/core/wardrobe.php)* set the theme to one of the new themes in *public/themes* folder (currently just *bootstrap*)

###Configuration###

There are some configuration options in *config/packages/koomai/wardrobe-themes/config.php*
- *theme* - You can swap out the default Bootstrap theme with one of the Bootswatch themes here. Options are listed in the comments.
- *excerpt* - By default the theme displays one paragraph of each post on the home page. Change this option to *false* to display entire posts.
- *fonts* - Some preset Google fonts combinations to override default fonts from Bootstrap/Bootswatch. Options are listed in the comments.
